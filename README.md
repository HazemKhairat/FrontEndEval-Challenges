# 🚀 Front-End Eval Challenges

Front-End Eval challenges are practical coding problems designed to mimic real-world front-end interview questions.  
They focus on:  
- 🖥️ Building interactive UIs  
- ⚡ Optimizing performance  
- 🎮 Adding interactivity (like memory games, timers, or forms)

---

### 🎯 Purpose
The purpose of working on these challenges is to practice core JavaScript concepts, such as:  
- ✨ Event handling  
- 🔄 State management  
- 🚀 Performance techniques  
- ⏱️ Asynchronous operations  

while strengthening my skills in **DOM manipulation** and overall **web development**.
